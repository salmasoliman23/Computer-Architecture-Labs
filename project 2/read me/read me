** Almost the simulator is working correctly with some minor exceptions.
Bugs:
====
1) flushing after ret is not that efficient. when returning , the instruction that will be written in the same cycle won't have time to be flushed from the
reservation station. and if not excuted, it won't be ever. it should be handled effciently.
2) when we find writing back at the same place we are in, we stop the clock. with ret , this is not working correctly.

we actually did not have enough time to handle them.

** if you want to run the program directly , open this link :

** if you want to run it through terminal , write these instructions: 
* make sure you have downloaded nodeJS(npm)
1)cd repo_name
2) npm i
3)npm start

** make sure after each test case to reload the page.
